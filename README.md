# IdeaBox

### Description
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." IdeaBox is an application that helps big-brained people like **YOU** record, remember, and archive those billion-dollar ideas (good and bad alike).

### How it Works
- Record an idea in IdeaBox by hitting the "Save" button! (Ideas *must* have a title & a body).
- Ideas are saved to local storage, so don't worry about leaving. All the ideas will be in IdeaBox once you come back.
- Ideas can be favorited by hitting the "star" button, or deleted by hitting the "X" button.
- You can view your favorite ideas by hitting the "Show Starred Ideas" button.
- If you have more ideas than you can count, you can narrow down specific ideas by using the "Search Ideas" bar!

### Technologies Implemented:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Updates
- Comments are currently unavailable, but will be added in future updates.
- Ability to share IdeaBox ideas on social media. Send your grandma your idea!
- CSS styling to make the page elements dynamic for mobile screen sizes.
- Ability to add media content to ideas (picture, video, sound).
